Routing and its types:

There are two types of routing ine is traditional and another one is attribute routing,Traditional routing has a pattern for matching the URl that takes the incoming requests for the controller and action,Attribute routing uses additional routes and attributes.

Action Filters:

Action filters are attribute which can be used in a controller action or for whole controller.This filter will be called before and after the action and at the end of action execution.
